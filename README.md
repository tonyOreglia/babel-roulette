# Babel Roulette 
The MOST important thing when it comes to learning a new language is simply to talk with native speakers. The more the better; and if there is a choice between this and other learning methods; talking to a native speaker is always preferable. 

However, this is not always so easy. For some, it's not comfortable striking up conversations with strangers; and when they do the conversation is short lived and irksome to the person forced to tutor this language learner. 

In many places, english is a universal second language; and so in some cases the language learner is constantly missing opportunities to learns as people switch to english for convenience. 

Event the websites designed to accommodate conversation exchanges require messaging people and scheduling a date/time to meet. 

I want to build a platform where a person can sign on and immediately be in conversation in their target language -- matched with another user that is on the platform. By just giving a passcode to uniquely identify themselves; they can gain credits by speaking in their native language; and then use the credits in their target language.

## Challenges 
- requires multiple concurrent users == solution here can be to choose a single hour time slot once per week and market heavily.
- need people to understand the concept so they see how it's useful -- barrier to entry
  - using a single passcode (no login) can be a confusing new concept to people if not done right
- Needs a nice UI ; can do but annoying / time consuming 
- needs secure DB to store people's credits


Estimate 3 months of work (working like 5 hours / week) (very roughly; finger in the air)
